            <b>Overview</b>
            <img class="disc" src="../img/splitter/disc.gif">
            <p>
                This program reads the binary of *.IFO files and parses information regarding titles and video clip durations.
                It then uses ffmpeg to split the accompanying *.VRO file into multiple *.mpg files
                without re-encoding. Note that splits may not be extremely accurate and there may be a few frames from the next
                clip in each clip.
                This can be mitigated by adjusting the "Split Offset" setting.
            </p>
            <b>Background</b>
            <p>
                I recently found an old Hitachi DVDRAM camcorder lying around and had some fun taking videos with it.
                When it came time to get the videos onto my computer, I ran into some trouble: There was only an *.IFO,
                and *.VRO
                file which was one video of all the clips that I had taken. There was no apparent way to split the file
                back into individual clips as the software that was provided was too old for my computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I eventually found programs like
                <a href="https://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/tmsr6.html" target="_blank">TMPGEnc Smart Encoder
                    6</a>
                that could split the *.VRO, but none of them were free. Also, with TMPGEnc, the clips need to be
                re-encoded to be split...
            </p>
            <p>
                While I was researching this file format I also found pixeldb's 
                <a href="https://github.com/pixelb/dvd-vr" target="_blank">
                    dvd-vr</a>, this seems to also work, but I'm not sure how it works. 
            </p>
