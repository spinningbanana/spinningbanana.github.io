            <b>Overview</b> 
            <img class="disc" src="../img/splitter/disc.gif">
            <p>
                I recently found an old Hitachi DVDRAM camcorder lying around and had some fun taking videos with it.
                When it came time to get the videos onto my computer, I ran into some trouble: There was only a .VRO
                file, which was one video of all the clips that I had taken, and there was no way to split the file
                back into individual clips as the software that was provided was too old for my computer.

                I eventually discovered programs like TMPGEnc that could split the .VRO, but none of them were free.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I decided to give it a try and wrote a program that splits .VRO files into .mpg files. This program
                reads the binary of .IFO files and uses ffmpeg to split the accompanying .VRO file into multiple .mpg files
                without re-encoding. Note that splits are not super accurate and there may be a few frames from the next clip in each clip.
                This can be mitigated by adjusting a few settings, however.
            </p>
