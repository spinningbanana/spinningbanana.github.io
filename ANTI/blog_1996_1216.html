				Hello everyone, it's been a while since my last update. I apologize for my absence, but I've been in a
				bit of a tough spot lately.
				As you might remember, I expressed some concerns in my last post about being followed and watched by
				unknown individuals.
				<br><br>
				Well, unfortunately, things didn't get any better. In fact, they got worse. A lot worse. I started to
				feel like I was living in a
				paranoid dream. Everywhere I went, I was convinced that someone was watching me. I couldn't sleep at
				night. I couldn't focus on
				anything else but my fear.
				<br><br>
				Eventually, I had to make a difficult decision. I had to leave my old life behind and start fresh
				somewhere else. It wasn't an easy
				decision, but it was the only way I could feel safe again.
				<br><br>
				Now, I'm living in a new place, with new people, and a new identity. I don't want to reveal too much,
				for fear that they might
				be reading this right now. But suffice it to say, I'm far away from my old life and trying to start
				over.
				<br><br>
				But the fear never truly goes away. I'm still paranoid, still looking over my shoulder, still wondering
				if I'm being watched.
				I don't know if I'll ever feel safe again. All I know is that I can't stop fighting. I can't let them
				win.
				<br><br>
				Unfortunately, I have come to the realization that I am unable to continue this blog. I will have to
				leave it behind, as it is too risky
				to continue. But I hope that my message has reached some of you, and that you will carry on the fight
				for truth and justice. Remember,
				even if they can silence one voice, they cannot silence us all.
				<br><br>
				Thank you for your support, and please, stay safe.
